hello world. my name is mary.<br>
    i am in a night class and i am very tired.<br>
    my interests are family, friends, the buffalo bills, and my pets<br>
    my relationship to video games are not really existent. i play some video games like mario kart, guitar hero, and maybe minecraft sometimes.<br>
    im taking this night class because it is a core class i have to take and its the one that sounded most interesting.
